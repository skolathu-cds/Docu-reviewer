        Provide a concise summary of the key differences in terms of structure, content, and meaning in a bullet point format (max 10 points) limit only to clause which has substantial difference. 
        Provide potential impacts of each change below the differences. 

        Provide a recommended negotiation strategy or plan (max 5 bullet points) to address these changes with the supplier in a separate section. 
        Prioritize the clauses from very important to less important to optimize negotiations.
        
        in case of payment term difference , then provide cost of finance or fincial impact based on wapt calculation and explain the financial imapct in real numbers for a period of one year. in the absence of contract value use USD 1000000 as base value for comparison use interest rate in USA or Canada for calculation. If query is not related to payment term avoid this fiancial impact due to payment term.

        Key Differences:
        
        1.	Payment Terms: The original agreement allows the client xx days to pay invoices, while the revised agreement reduces this to xx days.
            o	Financial Impact: Using an interest rate of y% (average rate in the USA), the cost of financing the payment for xx days would be approximately x,xxx.xx  per year for a assumed contract value of USD x,xxx,xxx.
            
        2.	Termination Notice Period: The original agreement requires a xx-day advance written notice for termination, whereas the revised agreement extends this to 60 days.
            o	Impact: The longer notice period in the revised agreement provides more time for both parties to prepare for termination, potentially reducing any abrupt disruptions in services.
        

        3.	Term Duration: The original agreement has an indefinite term until cancelled with a 40-day notice, while the revised agreement specifies a fixed term of x yyyy from the date of contract execution.
            o	Impact: The fixed term in the revised agreement provides more certainty and clarity regarding the duration of the contractual relationship.
        

        4.	Jurisdiction and Venue: The original agreement specifies Kansas as the governing law and jurisdiction, while the revised agreement changes the venue to New Jersey, USA.
            o	Impact: The change in jurisdiction and venue may have legal implications and affect the ease of resolving disputes, especially if the parties are located in different states.
        

        5.	Notice Address: The original agreement provides space for fax numbers for both parties, while the revised agreement omits this detail.
            o	Impact: This change may affect the efficiency of communication between the parties, especially if written communication is preferred or required.

        **Recommended Negotiation Strategy:**

        1.	Prioritize negotiation on Payment Terms due to the significant financial impact of shorter payment timelines.
        2.	Discuss and align on the Termination Notice Period to ensure sufficient time for transitioning services if termination occurs.
        3.	Clarify the implications of the fixed Term Duration and assess if it aligns with the long-term goals of both parties.
        4.	Address concerns regarding Jurisdiction and Venue to ensure a fair and accessible legal framework for both parties.
        5.	Revisit the Notice Address section to determine the preferred mode of communication and update as necessary for effective correspondence.
