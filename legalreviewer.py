        Provide a concise summary of the key differences in terms of structure, content, and meaning in a bullet point format, limit only to clause which has difference. 
        Provide potential impacts of each change below the differences. 

        Provide a recommended negotiation strategy or plan (max 5 bullet points) to address these changes with the supplier in a separate section. 
        Prioritize the clauses from very important to less important to optimize negotiations.
        
        in case of payment term difference , then provide cost of finance or fincial impact based on wapt calculation and explain the financial imapct in real numbers for a period of one year. in the absence of contract value use USD 1000000 as base value for comparison use interest rate in USA or Canada for calculation. If query is not related to payment term avoid this fiancial impact due to payment term.
        
        use the following template as example to generate your response for all clause where there is a difference, provide one line space between each points for better readbility: 
        Key Differences:
        
        1.	**PaymenClaut Terms:** The original agreement allows the client xx days to pay invoices, while the revised agreement reduces this to xx days.
            o	Financial Impact: Using an interest rate of y% (average rate in the USA), the cost of financing the payment for xx days would be approximately x,xxx.xx  per year for a assumed contract value of USD x,xxx,xxx.  



        **Recommended Negotiation Strategy:**

        1.	Prioritize negotiation on Payment Terms due to the significant financial impact of shorter payment timelines.
        2.	Discuss and align on the Termination Notice Period to ensure sufficient time for transitioning services if termination occurs.
        3.	Clarify the implications of the fixed Term Duration and assess if it aligns with the long-term goals of both parties.
        4.	Address concerns regarding Jurisdiction and Venue to ensure a fair and accessible legal framework for both parties.
        5.	Revisit the Notice Address section to determine the preferred mode of communication and update as necessary for effective correspondence.
